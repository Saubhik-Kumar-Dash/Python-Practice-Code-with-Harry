"""
1.Write a program to create a dictionary of Hindi words with values as their English translation. Provide user with an option to look it up!
2.Write a program to input eight numbers from the user and display all the unique numbers (once).
3.Can we have a set with 18 (int) and '18' (str) as a value in it?
4.What will be the length of following set s: 
        s = set() 
        s.add(20) 
        s.add(20.0) 
        s.add('20') # length of s after these operations?
5.s = {} What is the type of 's'?
6.Create an empty dictionary. Allow 4 friends to enter their favorite language as value and use key as their names. Assume that the names are unique.
7.If the names of 2 friends are same; what will happen to the program in problem 6?
8.If languages of two friends are same; what will happen to the program in problem 6?
9.Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S? 
        s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}
